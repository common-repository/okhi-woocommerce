== Description ==

All woocommerce default checkout fields such as country, state, etc would be removed or hidden to remain with only
First name
Last name
Phone
and a button to enable the user to launch the OkHi experience select an OkHi location.

This plugin uses OkHi location service for two purposes:

1. To seamlessly collect accurate location information for the customer.
   This plugin uses the OkHi Locations API to check whether the user has an existing OkHi location which is then displayed on the address card. If the user doesn’t have an existing location or they would like to use a different one for that transaction, they are asked to create a new one. See [documentation for the OkHi Locations API](https://docs.okhi.co/integrating-okhi/okhi-on-your-website?utm_source=okhi-woocommerce-plugin%20readme).

2) To enable you to view location based used insights e.g. see your location heatmap of your customers based on a specific parameter such order or frequency or product type.
   This plugin uses the OkHi Interactions API to send the interactions data to OkHi post-checkout so you can view it on the OKHi Insights dashboard. See [documentation for OkHi Insights API](https://docs.okhi.co/interactions?utm_source=okhi-woocommerce-plugin%20readme)

Once you install the plugin, you will need an api key from OkHi, visit [our business page](https://www.okhi.com/business?utm_source=okhi-woocommerce-plugin%20readme) to sign up for one.
